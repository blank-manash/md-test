# Vim Script Fundamentals

Create a wiki of files having new tasks

* Task 1
* Task 2

What is new in this, not really anything. Hence some code.

```cpp
int i = 1;
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for(int j = 0; j < m; ++j) 
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - j][j];
}
```
Since that's done, wanna know a formula

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{i=\infty}\dfrac{1}{i}=\dfrac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

Here You can find some more math blocks and code blocks, [extra](extra.md)
